# Just give me the text

I wanted to share a surprisingly elegant solution I found to copying text into
the clipboard where for one reason or another it's otherwise not possible.

```bash
flameshot gui --raw \
  | tesseract stdin stdout -l eng \
  | xclip -in -selection clipboard
```

- [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) :: Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine
- [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) :: Command line interface to the X11 clipboard

If you're using [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/), substitute `xclip`
for `wl-copy`:

```bash
flameshot gui --raw \
  | tesseract stdin stdout -l eng \
  | wl-copy
```

I didn't come up with this incantation, rather found it after a lot of searching
for a tool that solves this problem.

The `flameshot gui` launches a GUI that allows you to select a region of the
screen, and then press `enter`. The image output is piped to `tesseract` which
does the OCR and in turn pipes it to `xclip` or `wl-copy` which copies it to the
clipboard.

Note that `tesseract` has a lot of options, and you can specify the languages.

# Flameshot Alternatives

- [maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim) :: (make image) takes screenshots of your desktop.
- [grim](https://github.com/emersion/grim) :: Grab images from a Wayland compositor

Some Reddit users suggested these alternatives to flameshot:

```bash
grim -g "$(slurp)" -
```

```bash
maim -s
```

I haven't tried `grim` because I'm not using Wayland yet, but `maim` is a great!
One advantage of `maim` in this use case is that it doesn't require pressing
`Enter`.
